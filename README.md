Hello Everyone this is Ankit Bhatia, Student Full-Stack Developer pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science

This is one of my project's in Java-Python Developement field  which i have created,basically Java and Python Based 
Student Security Attendence System called Staysafe Security System that uses the property of Face Recognition as well as QR Based Attendence Punching by the students.

### For More Details or Any Suggestions u can Reach me at ankit.bhatia1220@gmail.com

- Students punch their attendence using QR Code on their ID Cards over the inbuilt application webcam QR scanner.

- Before punching the attendence they need to scan their face onto the webcam/camera to ensure they are the same as they are labelled to be for the case of security.


- On sucessfull punching their QR Code, attendence will be punched and a Message will be sent to their guardians on their safe arrival in school


- Functionality for Admin /School

			* Creation of daily attendence report,complete student record,and monthy attendence record of each child.

			* Sending SMS to absent as well as present students(and how much late they are to school) to their guardian mobile number

			* Creating new student profile,QR code if a new student takes admission in School.
